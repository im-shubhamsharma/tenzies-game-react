# Tenzies Game

Tenzies is a dice game used to demonstrate the use of React Hooks (useState, useEffect).

> In this game, the user can freeze the dice by clicking the ones that have the same values, and roll the remaining until all the dice show the same face. The goal of this app is to practice the core features of React, such as useState and useEffect hooks, conditional rendering etc; as well as CSS Grid, used to style the pips of the dice.
